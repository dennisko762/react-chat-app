# react-chat-app

Hello there,

this is a simple React chat application based on websockets.
The frontend is placed in the chat folder and contains some components.
The backend is placed in ther server folder. The websocket is implemented using socket.io and node.js

To run the app download the repository and copy server and chat to seperate empty folder.
If you use vscode open the folder and open the split terminal.
Navigate to the server folder in one terminal and navigate to chat folder in the other folder and run npm start in both.
Done, have fun.
