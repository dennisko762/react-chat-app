# react-chat-app

Hello there,

this is a simple React chat application based on websockets.
I followed a little tutorial on youtube and programmed it myself afterwards to practise React backend programming.
The frontend is placed in the chat folder and contains some components.
The backend is placed in ther server folder. The websocket is implemented using socket.io and node.js
